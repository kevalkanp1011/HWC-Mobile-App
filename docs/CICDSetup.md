## CI/CD Pipeline for Android Build and Distribute ⚙️

Our CI/CD pipeline uses **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and distribution process of the Android application. The key workflow configuration files are:

- **[android.yml](./.github/workflows/android.yml)**
- **[build-distribute.yml](./.github/workflows/build-distribute.yml)**

### Workflows Overview

The pipeline consists of two primary workflow files:

1. **`android.yml`**: Handles triggering events, setting up a build matrix for various environments, and invoking the distribution workflow.
2. **`build-distribute.yml`**: Contains the detailed steps to build, sign, and distribute the app through Firebase and GitHub Releases.

---

### Workflow: `android.yml`

Triggered by:

- **Manual Runs** via `workflow_dispatch` 🔄
- **Push Events** on the `develop` branch
- **Pull Request Events** targeting `develop`

#### Matrix Configuration

This file uses a matrix strategy to build different configurations. The environments and build types include:

- **HLW_STAG**
  - *Variant*: `staging`
  - *Build Type*: `debug`
- **HLW_UAT**
  - *Variant*: `uat`
  - *Build Type*: `debug`

#### Job Details

## Android `build.gradle` File Documentation 📜

### Overview

The `build.gradle` file is used to configure the Android application module. It includes settings for the Android build system, dependencies, and additional build configurations.

### Key Sections

#### `splits`

The `splits` block is used to configure APK generation for different ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces). This allows the creation of separate APKs for different device architectures, which can help reduce the size of the APK.

```gradle
splits {
    abi {
        enable true          // Enables ABI splits, allowing the build system to create separate APKs for each architecture.
        reset()              // Clears any previous ABI configurations, ensuring a clean configuration.
        include 'armeabi-v7a', 'arm64-v8a', 'x86', 'x86_64'  // Specifies the ABIs for which APKs should be generated:
        // armeabi-v7a: ARM 32-bit architecture
        // arm64-v8a: ARM 64-bit architecture
        // x86: Intel 32-bit architecture
        // x86_64: Intel 64-bit architecture
        universalApk true    // Generates a universal APK that includes all the specified ABIs.
    }
}
```
- **`enable true`**: Enables ABI splits, allowing the build system to create separate APKs for each architecture.
- **`reset()`**: Resets any previous ABI configurations, ensuring a clean configuration.
- **`include 'armeabi-v7a', 'arm64-v8a', 'x86', 'x86_64'`**: Specifies the ABIs for which APKs should be generated. This includes:
  - `armeabi-v7a`: ARM 32-bit architecture
  - `arm64-v8a`: ARM 64-bit architecture
  - `x86`: Intel 32-bit architecture
  - `x86_64`: Intel 64-bit architecture
- **`universalApk true`**: Generates a universal APK that includes all the specified ABIs. This APK can run on any device but will be larger in size compared to the individual ABI-specific APKs.

#### `externalNativeBuild`

The `externalNativeBuild` block is used to configure the build system for native code. It specifies the use of CMake and the path to the CMakeLists.txt file, which contains the build instructions for the native code.

```gradle
externalNativeBuild {
    cmake {
        path file("src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt")
    }
}
ndkVersion "27.2.12479018"
```

- **`cmake`**: Specifies that CMake is used for the native build.
  - **`path file("src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt")`**: Sets the path to the CMakeLists.txt file, which contains the configuration and build instructions for the native code.
- **`ndkVersion "27.2.12479018"`**: Specifies the version of the Android NDK (Native Development Kit) to be used. This ensures compatibility between the NDK version and the build configurations.

### Additional Information

- **`namespace`**: Defines the package namespace for the application.
- **`compileSdk 34`**: Specifies the SDK version used to compile the application.
- **`defaultConfig`**: Contains default settings for the application, including application ID, minimum and target SDK versions, version code, and version name.
- **`buildTypes`**: Defines different build types, such as `release` with settings for minification and resource shrinking.
- **`flavorDimensions` and `productFlavors`**: Used to define product flavors for different environments like `sakshamStag`, `sakshamUat`, `saksham`, `xushrukha`, and `niramay`.
- **`compileOptions` and `kotlinOptions`**: Configure Java and Kotlin compilation settings.
- **`dataBinding` and `viewBinding`**: Enable data binding and view binding features.

### Guidelines for Changing the Version

The version management is handled by the `versioning.gradle` file, which reads the version from the `version/version.properties` file. To change the version:

versioning.gradle
The versioning.gradle file includes logic to manage and retrieve the version information for the application. Here is the content of the file:

```gradle
ext {
    buildVersionCode = {
        def versionName = buildVersionName()
        def (major, minor, patch) = versionName.toLowerCase().tokenize('.')
        major.toInteger()
    }
    buildVersionName = {
        def props = new Properties()
        rootProject.file("version/version.properties").withInputStream { props.load(it) }
        return props.getProperty("VERSION")
    }
}
```

1. **Open the `version/version.properties` File**:
   - Navigate to `version/version.properties`.

2. **Update the Version**:
   - Modify the `VERSION` property to the new version. For example, to increment from `5.0.0` to `6.0.0`:
     ```ini
     VERSION=6.0.0
     ```

3. **Save the File**:
   - Save the `version.properties` file with the updated version.


## Firebase App Distribution Configurations

groups.txt
-	Purpose: Defines the groups of testers for Firebase App Distribution. Groups should be comma-separated (e.g., `group-1, group-2`).
-	Content: `trusted-testers`: A group named "trusted-testers" that is used to manage testers who are trusted to receive app distributions.

release_notes.txt
-	Purpose: Contains the release notes for the app distribution.
-	Content:  For example, `In this version, we improved the user experience and fixed some bugs.`: A brief note describing improvements and bug fixes in the current version.
